#FinTrackr: Personal finances and budgeting app

##Inputs

Users can either provide a csv of data (e.g. credit card statements downloaded from a bank), or enter line items manually.

FinTrackr will then classify each expense (or income) by category (groceries, eating out, etc) and whether the expense is recurring, and on what frequency. Initially classification will be manual, but v2 will use an LLM agent.

##Use cases

The (eventual) interface will include visualizations of money on hand over time, monthly budgets calculated from both anticipated recurring expenses and extrapolations from past irregular expenditures, etc.
